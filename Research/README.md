# The Moustache

Moustaches come in all shapes, colours and sizes. Every moustache has its own history, story and message.

These days, moustaches are even saving lives with the creation of Movember.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn more coding language and to improve my skills so that I can offer website creation as a service to clients.
