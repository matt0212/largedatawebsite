# The Sword

Swords come in all shapes and sizes. Every Sword has its own history, style and use.

These days, swords are not used for battle, but are still used in some areas of the world.

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

Iâ€™m excited to learn more coding language and to improve my skills so that I can offer website creation as a service to clients.
