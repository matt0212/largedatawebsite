Historically, **katana** were one of the traditionally made Japanese swords that were worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan, also commonly referred to as a *samurai sword*. Modern versions of the katana are sometimes made using non-traditional materials and methods.

The katana is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard and long grip to accommodate two hands. It has historically been associated with the [samurai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai) of feudal Japan and has become renowned for its sharpness and strength.
