The **sabre** or **saber** (see [spelling differences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#-re.2C_-er)) is a kind of [backsword](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backsword) that usually has a curved, single-edged blade and a rather large hand guard, covering the knuckles of the hand as well as the thumb and forefinger. Although sabres are typically thought of as curved-bladed slashing weapons, those used by the world's heavy cavalry often had straight and even double-edged blades more suitable for thrusting. The length of sabres varied, and most were carried in a [scabbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabbard) hanging from a shoulder belt known as a [baldric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldric) or from a waist-mounted sword belt, usually with slings of differing lengths to permit the scabbard to hang below the rider's waist level.
