## Observations

- They both asked if the cards Kinds Of Swords and The Sword were already group titles.
- After I told them no, they easily grouped all the cards.
- I was surprised when I saw Colby had grouped them in exactly the same way Patrick had.
- The only difference was the names they chose for the groups (they were still very similar).
- They grouped them the way I would probably have grouped them. Maybe I subconsciously had groups in mind when creating the cards...
- I was happy to see that they grouped them the way I would have.
